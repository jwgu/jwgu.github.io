	We present a computational imaging method for raw material 
	classification using features of Bidirectional Texture Functions 
	(BTF). Texture is an intrinsic feature for many materials, such as 
	wood, fabric, and granite. At appropriate scales, even " uniform " 
	materials will also exhibit texture features that can be helpful for 
	recognition, such as paper, metal, and ceramic. To cope with the 
	high-dimensionality of BTFs, in this project, we proposed to simultaneously learn 
	discriminative illumination patterns and texture filters, with which 
	we can directly measure optimal projections of BTFs for 
	classification. We also studied the effects of texture rotation and 
	scale variation for material classification. We built an LED-based 
	multispectral dome, with which we have acquired a BTF database of a 
	variety of materials and demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
	proposed approach for material classification.

	number of filters. This indicate that the classification of aluminum 
	and stainless can be performed well on a subspace of BTF with lower 
	dimensionality. The observation is similar in [Varma05] that some 
	texture classification tasks can be performed well even though the 
	sampling patch size is small (i.e., using more local feature). 
	Within each filter bank, the spatial frequency of the learned filter 
	increases with the index of filter. This indicates that the 
	difference of the projection of BTF is concentrated on the low 
	spatial frequencies.</p>
