<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>As a global feature of fingerprints, the orientation field is important
for automatic fingerprint recognition. Many algorithms have been
proposed for orientation field estimation, but their results are
unsatisfactory for poor quality fingerprint images. In this project, we
proposed a analytic model for the 2D orientation field of fingerprint
texture patterns. The proposed model includes both a bivariate
polynomial component for fitting the global orientation field, and
"point-charge" models for each of the singular points to further improve
the accuracy of the modeling. 

<p>This analytic model then can be used to: compute high-quality orientation
field for poor quality images, store the orientation field with a few
parameters, and together with the minutiae points form a complete
representation of fingerprints which can then be used for reconstruction
and synthesis of fingerprint images. 

<p>Based on this analytic model, we can also use the orientation field as 
as a discriminant global feature for recognition. 
We combined it with the widely-used local
feature---minutiae points in recognition and showed it can largely
improve the recognition performance.

<p>Finally, we investigated the orientation field patterns around the
singular points (i.e., core and delta points), derived topological
principles for the singular points, and applied these principles 
for detecting singular points, especially for poor-quality images.
