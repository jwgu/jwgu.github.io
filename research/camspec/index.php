<p>
Camera spectral sensitivity functions relate scene radiance with captured RGB 
triplets. They are important for many computer vision tasks that use color 
information, such as multispectral imaging, color rendering, and color constancy. 
In this paper, we aim to explore the space of spectral sensitivity 
functions for digital color cameras. After collecting a database of 28 
cameras covering a variety of types, we find this space convex and 
two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we propose two methods to 
recover camera spectral sensitivities using regular reflective color targets 
(e.g., color checker) from a single image with and without knowing the 
illumination. We show the proposed model is more accurate and robust for 
estimating camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also 
show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral sensitivities â€” 
simulation of color rendering for cameras and computational color 
constancy.</p>');
