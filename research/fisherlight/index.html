 Classifying raw, unpainted materials --- metal, plastic, ceramic,
   fabric, etc. --- is an important yet challenging task for computer
   vision.  Previous works measure subsets of surface spectral
   reflectance as features for classification. However, acquiring the
   full surface reflectance is time-consuming and error-prone. In this
   project, we propose to use coded illumination to directly measure
   discriminative features for material classification. Optimal
   illumination patterns---which we call ``discriminative
   illumination"---are learned from training samples, after projecting
   to which, the spectral reflectance of different materials are
   maximally separated. This projection is automatically realized by the
   integration of incident light for surface reflection.  While a single
   discriminative illumination is capable of linear, two-class
   classification, we show that multiple discriminative illuminations
   can be used for nonlinear and multi-class classification. We also
   show theoretically the proposed method has higher signal-to-noise
   ratio than previous methods due to light multiplexing.  Finally, we
   construct a LED-based multi-spectral dome and use the discriminative
   illumination method for classifying a variety of raw materials,
   including metal (aluminum, alloy, steel, stainless steel, brass and
   copper), plastic, ceramic, fabric and wood.  Experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></td></tr>

								<strong>Discriminative illumination as a physically-based

								<p class="mediadescription">Our core idea is to use coded illumination as a 
	classifier. (a) A schematic diagram in which coded illumination
	acts as a linear classifier, after projecting to which the spectral
	BRDFs of different materials are maximally separated. (b) An example
	of aluminum-vs-alloy classification. The image is captured by one of
	the 150 LEDs of the dome which yields the best classification
	performance on training data. Its classification rate on testing
	data is 41\%. (c) We train a linear kernel SVM classifier from the
	same training data, with the classification rate of 95% on the
	testing data. The bar graph shows the learned SVM light, w, where
    the 25 bar groups correspond to the 25 LED clusters and the six bars
	within each group correspond to the six LEDs. The vertical axis
	shows the relative brightness of each LED.  Since the SVM light,
	w, has negative
	values, we implement it as the difference of two nonnegative
	vectors. (d) and (e) show the corresponding light
	patterns on the top view of the LED dome. The colors of the nodes show
	the spectra of the LED clusters. (f) and (g) show the
	corresponding captured images. (h) shows the difference of (f) and
	(g), which is used for classification. (i) is the classification
	result, shown as a binary image.</p>
